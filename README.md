## Goal Summary
The goal of social media activities is to:
* promote activities and events of the Chicago Digital Accessibility & Inclusive Design Meetup, including new member acquisition
* promote activities and events related to accessibility, including other meetups in other geographic locations (as we have a global reach), local accessibility-related events, etc.
* create awareness of digital accessibility, through articles, blog posts, etc. related to digital accessibility.

## Social Channels Used
We use Twitter and Facebook for social media marketing. Twitter has one single account. On Facebook, we have a group and a page; these could be consolidated to the best platform. We used to publish to LinkedIn, but lost that with a change to social media management software.

## Methods Used for Managing Social Media Posts
Presently, we use Tweetdeck for Twitter posts. For Facebook, we use Facebook's native scheduling capabilities for Pages and Groups.

Hootsuite was used to manage posts to Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. However, with a recent change to the number of posts that could be scheduled for free accounts, Hootsuite was dropped. I have looked at Buffer, but have not made the move yet.

One important thing that will likely drive which platform we use is support of alt text on attached media. Presently, neither Hootsuite, Buffer or Tweetdeck provide this support. Buffer has support in their product roadmap, but no date has been communicated for a release.

## Types of Posts
We post several types of posts.
### A11YChi Promotional
These posts promote upcoming A11YChi events.
Example:
> Join the waitlist for Accessibility for Everyone with @laurakalbag Nov 15th https://www.meetup.com/a11ychi/events/243947005/ #a11y #webdev #accessibility #design #ux 

At times, we'll also prompt for sharing of posts, especially if we are behind the RSVPs for an event:

>Pls RT RSVP for Accessibility Legal Update with @LFLegal Oct. 19 meetup.com/a11ychi/events… #legal #a11y #accessibility #chicagotech

I typically start posting event promotional posts as soon as we get confirmation from the presenter and venue. I increase frequency of these posts as we get closer. Once we're within a week of the RSVP deadline, or the event if not need to send RSVPs to our venue sponsor in advance, we change the post to note the approaching deadline.

> RSVP by tomorrow at noon for our next meetup, Accessibility Legal Update with @LFLegal http://meetup.com/a11ychi/events… #legal #a11y #accessibility

### A11YChi Event Supportive
We have several types of posts that help support an actual A11YChi meetup event.
#### Live Stream
After the RSVP deadline passes, we post the live stream URL. The day of the event, we post the live stream URL out several times that day; morning, afternoon and near the time of the event. If the event begins at 6:30pm CT, I post this post at 6pm, 6:15pm and 6:30pm. THis last half hour, I tend to limit the posts to Twitter only.

> Our live stream of tonight's meetup, Accessibility Legal Update with @LFLegal begins in 30 mins. goo.gl/hoyaiK #a11y #accessibility #legal

**Note:** we use a Google Shortened URL for tracking purposes.

#### Live Captions
Similar to the live stream posts (but admitedly with less frequency), I post on the live captions information.

> Live captions for tonight's Accessibility Legal Update with @LFLegal goo.gl/ZRh6w7 #a11ychi #a11y #accessibility #legal

**Note:** we use a Google Shortened URL for tracking purposes.

#### Hashtag Posts
The day of the event, I post the information on how to follow along with hashtag a11ychi. The frequency increases up to the time of the event and at least one shortly after the time.

> Follow along with tonight's Accessibility Legal Update with @LFLegal and ask questions too  by following hashtag #a11ychi

#### Sponsorship Posts
The day of the event, I post, thanking the sponsors for the event. These sponsors presently include:
* The Venue
* ACS Captions, provider of captions
* McDonalds, sponsor of captions
* Sticker Giant, provider of meetup stickers
* Rosenfeld Media, provider of book discounts
* Any other sponsors we have for an event
I typically post these once in the afternoon and once immediately after the event (7:30-8pm).
Examples:
> Thanks to @ACSCaptions for providing #captions for tonight's Accessibility Legal Update. acscaptions.com #a11ychi #a11y

> Thanks to @McDonalds for sponsoring the live captions for tonight's Accessibility Legal Update. #a11ychi

> Thanks to @stickergiant for the meetup stickers! Make sure to grab yours at tonight's meetup. stickergiant.com #a11ychi

> Thanks to @RosenfeldMedia for the discount to #A11yChi members. Get great books at 20% off w/discount code a11ychi rosenfeldmedia.com

### Promotional for other A11Y Meetups, Local Meetups and Events
I monitor other meetups and events for accessibility topics. I use Meetup.com by following many other tech and accessibility meetups here in Chicago and other metropolitan cities. I receive other tech events with accessibility topics from Twitter, email, etc.

### Information and News
This makes up the bulk of posts seen on a daily basis. Posting these has created awareness and educated folks in the digital space. The reach for these have been worldwide. While I'd like to continue these, I'd love to find a way to get more attention to these from local digital pros.

### Special Posts/Series
For some events, that have individual segments like Inclusive Design 24, I will promote the event normally, then I will schedule posts for each segment. I've also created marathons, posts linking to accessibility videos, on holiday weekend, such as Memorial Day and Labor Day, mimicing the programming on many cable networks. 

## Characteristics of an Accessible Post
Two things to consider are abbreviations used, typically due to character constrainst. If abbreviations are used, try to use commonly known abbreviations. Hashtags should be keep, when ever possible, after the URL or at the end of the post.

While the method we use to post doesn't allow for alternative text for images, we post most posts with images, as they attract eye attention.

Examples:
* https://twitter.com/A11YChi/status/927960091357302784
* https://twitter.com/A11YChi/status/927951283465609216
* https://twitter.com/A11YChi/status/926803720192458754

## Content Acquisition
I aquire content for posts from several sources.
### Twitter search using Hashtags
#a11y is the most popular search hashtag, followed by the long form #accessibility. You can also search on select disability and assistive technology hashtags, such as #cognitive, #autism, #blind, #deaf, #hoh #deafblind, #nvda #jaws, etc.

## Hashtags Used

## Post Types per Weekday/Weekend Day
I tend to post technical, UX and design-specific articles and blog posts, event announcements, etc. during the week days. For the weekends, like a magazine or special sections of a Sunday paper, I post items that may take more time to dig into, such as articles on specific disabilities, assistive technology, videos of presentations and talks etc.

## Times of Day
Weekdays, I post starting 10:30am (seems like a break time for many) through lunch, into early afternoon. Sometimes I'll post during the evening commute. Weekends, I tend ti keep it early to mid-mornings before peope start their weekend activities. I may also post late afternoon Saturdays, and early evening Sundays.
